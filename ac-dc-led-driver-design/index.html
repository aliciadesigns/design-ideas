<p>A challenge in designing these LED bulbs is that LED light as we know works on DC voltage and the mains power supply is AC hence we need to design a LED Driver circuit that could convert the AC mains voltage into suitable level of DC voltage required for the LED bulb. Universal Input 45W AC-DC LED Driver Reference Design. Save 10 on Orders 500 New Subscribers. LED Lighting Design Guide Safety and Reliability of LED Bulbs An LED lamp contains power conversion electronics ACDC driver IC for the LEDs a heat sink for thermal management and optics to optimize light quality. Although AC is input to this LED bridge circuit configuration the LEDs are still driven with DC and this approach requires more drive power than a true AC-LED design.</p>

<p>Board-level C3LED device One early form of a true AC-LED system in which the devices operate when connected directly to an AC supply is the Christmas tree light approach. Since LED bulbs are intended to be form factor-compatible with current incandescent and CFL bulbs they will have an ACDC power. Although AC is input to this LED bridge circuit configuration the LEDs are still driven with DC and this approach requires more drive power than a true AC-LED design. Featuring an adjustable off time generator the controller can drive a MOSFET up to a switching frequency of 500 kHz. Pin On Technik Elektronik.</p>
