<p>The firm offers a full range of design services including architectural design programming master planning historic restoration landscape design interior design and furniture design. Weve spoken to interior designers and most of them work with art galleries warehouses art consultants and even the artists themselves to procure and purchase fine art for their clients. I think a successful artist will not be offended by this but understand the opportunity of developing a long-term relationship with a designer who will bring them clients.
