<p><strong>Adaptive Design Definition</strong>, Definition Making planned well-defined changes in key clinical trial design parameters during trial execution based on data from that trial to achieve goals of validity scientific efficiency and safety Planned. Adaptive learning or adaptive teaching is the delivery of custom learning experiences that address the unique needs of an individual through just-in-time feedback. In their recent publication with the emphasis of the feature of by design adaptations only rather than ad hoc adaptations the PhRMA Working Group on Adaptive Design refers to an adaptive design as a clinical trial design that uses accumulating data to decide on how to modify aspects of the study as it continues without undermining the validity and integrity of the trial. Technology-based adaptive learning systems or e-learning systems can provide students with immediate assistance resources specific to their learning needs and relevant feedback that students may need.</p>
