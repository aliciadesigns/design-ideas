<p>This review discusses the rigorous experimental design and sample preparation in the context of applying metagenomics in environmental sciences and biotechnology. The designing of the experiment and the analysis of obtained data are inseparable. Design of experiment DOEDOE is defined as a structured organized method for determining the relationship between factors affecting a process and the output of that process. This book tends towards examples from behavioral and social sciences but includes a full range of examples. The experimental design may also identify variables that must be held constant to prevent external uncontrollable factors affecting the results.</p>

<p>Besides experimental designs not only involve the selection of suitable independent dependent and control variables but also planning the experiments under statistically optimal conditions. Not only is the DOE concept easily understood the factorial experiment designs are easy to construct efficient and capable of determining interaction effects. It uses a simple experimental design to screen and optimize a number of experimental parameters in formulation development. A design that chooses experimental points uniformly scattered on the domain is known as uniform experimental design and uniform experimental design can be regarded as a fractional factorial design with model uncertainty a space-filling design for computer experiments a robust design against the model specification and a supersaturated design and can be applied to experiments with mixtures.
