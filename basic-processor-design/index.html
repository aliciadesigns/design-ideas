<p>Practical Introduction to Computer Architecture. Before we start looking at computer architecture in detail we will revise the main components of a computer system and the basic fetch-execute cycle. The basic philosophy behind RISC is to move the complexity from the silicon to the language compiler. This makes it very difficult to see why one was constructed in the way it was.</p>
