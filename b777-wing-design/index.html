<p><strong>B777 Wing Design</strong>, In older design wings drag rise was pretty fast after Mcrit. This involves the definition of the wing section and the planform. The design is typical of previous Boeing airliners except it is equipped with only two engines unlike the transcontinental 707 and 747. The B77789 could use the fuselage of the earlier versions with a stretch ie retaining the same fuselage cross-section but lengthening it.</p>
