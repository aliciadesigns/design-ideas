<p>In this article we will take a close look at architectural concepts and how it fits in with the design process. Studying the Massing Models on the site considering. Other than being able to think critically and creatively architecture students also need to be able to think pragmatically in Design Studio. The design process can be daunting to new students who often find it difficult to find a direction in their design.</p>

<p>TECHNOLGICAL DESIGN Architectural Design Process 3. It also gives students the tools to develop their own unique. Engineers design the structure according to the architects design including electrical drawings structural layout and plumbing. This design process begins with the civil site plan and moves forward to the floorframing then through the plumbing and electrical plans. Prepare developed design drawings addressing any issues raised from the concept stage and incorporating refinements changes and further development.</p>
