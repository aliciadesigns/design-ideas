<p>Treks design is similar to the Split Pivot design that is patented by Dave Weagle of DW-link fame. The suspension designs are a two dimensional concept with each bar linkage connected by pivots two and three bar linkages do not permit movement. The most obvious difference with this design is that the bottom bracket and therefore the entire drivetrain is positioned on a link between the front and rear triangles. Many good designs have appeared ranging from the venerable pivoting rear triangle. Suspension is the term given to the system comprise of springs shock absorbers and linkages that connects a vehicle to its wheels.</p>
